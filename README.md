# Project Summary
This is a small project to create a dropdown menu that can be activated on click or by hovering. There is also an image carousel that will have an option to switch manually or automatically.

## Things learned throughout this project:
- Have to make sure webpack config files have the correct paths to the index files or else webpack will not work...
- Gaining a bit more experience with a modular design pattern
- Accessing the file upload button in css uses "::file-selector-button" pseudoclass
